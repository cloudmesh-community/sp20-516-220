1. Why do you need to use venv for this class?

  venv sets up an isolated Python runtime environment in a directory of your choosing.  The isolated
  environment helps to keep any installed dependencies isolated across projects and/or the system
  and it doesn't require root access for installing dependencies.  Isolation is the critical aspect here.
  Often times, different projects will require slightly different versions of dependencies, without a virtual
  environment you will end up with broken projects when a dependency in one project
  has resulted in an unplanned upgrade of a dependency in another.
